2     P1,P2    50pin Female Connecter<br>
1     F1       1206 *1A PolySwitch<br>
1     R1       0805 330ohms Resistor<br>
1     LED1     0805(1206 is attachable) SMD LED<br> 

*In the case of the SE/30, a 30V1A polyswitch is used, so I think that the same value or a slightly smaller value will suffice. Can be bypassed with a jumper if not needed.<BR>

* Cheap Chinese connectors can be used, but they are tight and difficult to use.I can recommend a good one even if it is expensive.
